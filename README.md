# OscarMap

> “When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is just to live your life inside the world. Try not to bash into the walls too much. Try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. That's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact: Everything around you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it… Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.”

> &mdash; Steve Jobs

So of course, I made a fixed-size hash map in Python...

## Getting Started

To clone this project, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/ohong/oscar-map

# Go into the repository
$ cd oscar-map
```

This project was coded in Python 2.7. Most Macs come with it already installed, but it’s good to double-check the version. To determine whether you have Python 2.7, open the Terminal application, type the following, and press Return:

```bash
$ python -V
```

This command will report the version of Python:

```bash
Python 2.7.10
```

Any version between 2.7.0 and 2.7.10 is fine. If you have a different version of Python (earlier or later) or if you do not get a response to the command at all, then you should [download and install Python 2.7.10](https://www.python.org/downloads/). Find and select the Mac OS X installer file that matches your system. The file will download, and opening it will begin the installation.

## Running the Tests

OscarMap was built following the principles of [test-driven development](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Test-driven_development). To see the tests in action, run:

```bash
$ python tests.py
```

All errors/warning/info messages will be logged to `log_file.txt`. View it to understand how OscarMap works under the hood!
